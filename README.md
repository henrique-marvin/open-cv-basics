 How to open an image, a video and a webcam with OpenCV library.

 So, in the first time trying to run this codes it's necessary to install the OpenCV libraty on your Python Enviroment. 

 To do this, you can use:

#### pip install opencv-python

For both open-image.py and open-video.py you only need to set the image/video path to run the code. 
And you can, also, set a name for the window, in the **window_name** variable, but this step is not mandatory.
